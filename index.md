I am a Postdoc researcher at the Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research and affiliated with the working group *Governance of Ecosystem Services* led by Tobias Vorlaufer. My research interests include stated preference methods and analysing farmer behaviour through the application of experimental approaches. My PhD focussed *On the Institutional Design of Agri-Environmental Contracts: Evidence from Preferences, Attitudes, and Identities*.

Being formerly trained in Economics (B.Sc. and M.Sc.), I enjoy working empirically by applying the most up-to-date statistical methods. While studying Ecological Economics (M.Sc.) at Edinburgh University, I became more familiar with qualitative approaches to improve stakeholder engagement in the environmental sphere. Thus, I combine my quantitative skill set with transdisciplinary-participatory approaches in my current research activities.

While presently being based in Müncheberg (Germany), I was fortunate to spend parts of my academic education in Mexico, Canada and the UK. During my stays abroad I developed a passion for intercultural exchange and constantly widened my approaches to conducting research. For that reason being, I consider myself a strong advocate of transdisciplinary research.

In my free time, I enjoy running and woodworking of all kinds.
